The Naives Bayes family of algorithms are some of the most used algorithms
in text classification and analysis.Naive Bayes is a family of 
probabilistic classifiers based on Bayes theorem to classify data into different classes. It works on the 
assumption of independence of all features.
The Naive Bayes family can be classify into three based on the distribution of features to be analyzed.

In this project we implement binary naive Bayes algorithm for multinomial distribution in sentiment analysis.
$$ P(A|B) =\frac{P(A)P(B|A)}{P(B)}$$
